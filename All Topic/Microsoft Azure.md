What is Microsoft Azure?
Microsoft Azure is Microsoft’s cloud computing platform offering Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). It provides tools to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers worldwide.

### 1. Compute

-   **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)** – Cloud-based Windows/Linux servers
    
-   **Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets** – Auto-scaling VM clusters
    
-   **App Services** – Host web applications (PaaS)
    
-   **Azure Functions** – Serverless compute for event-driven apps

### 2. Networking

-   **Virtual Network (VNet)** – Isolated private networks in Azure
    
-   **Network Security Groups (NSG)** – Control traffic to subnets/VMs
    
-   **Azure VPN Gateway** – Connect on-prem to cloud securely
    
-   **Azure ExpressRoute** – Dedicated high-speed connection to Azure
    
-   **Azure Firewall / Azure DDoS Protection**

### 3. Storage
Blob Storage – Object storage for unstructured data

File Storage – Fully managed file shares in the cloud

Disk Storage – Persistent disk volumes for VMs

Archive Storage – Cold storage for backup and infrequent access

### 4. Identity and Access Management
Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory) – Identity and access for Azure and M365

SSO, MFA, Conditional Access

Azure AD Connect (for hybrid identity)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Grant granular access by role

Privileged Identity Management (PIM) – Just-in-time access for admins

### 5. Monitoring & Management
Azure Monitor – Metrics, logs, alerts

Log Analytics – Search and analyze log data

Azure Advisor – Recommendations for performance, security, and cost

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) – Deploy and manage infrastructure as code

### 6. Security & Compliance
Microsoft Defender for Cloud – Threat protection for resources

Azure Security Center – Security posture management

Azure Key Vault – Manage secrets, keys, and certificates

Policy & Blueprints – Enforce organizational standards

### 7. Backup & Disaster Recovery
Azure Backup – Protect VMs, files, databases

Azure Site Recovery – Disaster recovery for on-prem and cloud workloads

### 8. Databases
Azure SQL Database – Managed relational SQL service

Cosmos DB – Globally distributed NoSQL database

Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL
