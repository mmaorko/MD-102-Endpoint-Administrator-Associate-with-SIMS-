🧭 1. Core Understanding of MD-102

🧠 What Is Microsoft Entra ID?
• 	Formerly known as Azure Active Directory, Entra ID is Microsoft’s cloud-native Identity as a Service (IDaaS) platform.
• 	It manages user identities, authentication, and access control across cloud apps like Microsoft 365, Azure, and thousands of third-party SaaS applications.
• 	Entra ID supports single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), conditional access policies, and identity governance for hybrid and remote environments.

🔍 Key Differences Between Entra ID and On-Prem A
  

Exam MD-102 covers four main domains:
| Section                                   | Weight | Focus                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1️⃣ Deploy Windows Client                 | 25–30% | Installation, configuration, and image deployment      |
| 2️⃣ Manage Identity and Compliance        | 15–20% | Azure AD, Intune policies, conditional access          |
| 3️⃣ Manage, Maintain, and Protect Devices | 40–45% | Intune, device configuration, Windows Update, Defender |
| 4️⃣ Manage Apps                           | 10–15% | App deployment, policies, Store apps, Win32 apps       |



🔹 Note 1: Understand the Role

Before you jump into tools or labs, know what an Endpoint Administrator does every day:

Deploy & manage Windows devices (mainly Windows 10/11)

Secure and update those devices

Manage apps and configurations

Enforce compliance through Intune & Entra ID (Azure AD)

📍 Goal: You understand why you’re doing these things — not just how.

🔹 Note 2: Learn the Core Building Blocks

Start with these three fundamentals before diving into Intune.

🧩 1. Windows Client Fundamentals

Windows 10/11 editions & licensing

Imaging and deployment methods

Windows update process (WUfB, WSUS, Feature vs Quality updates)

Device drivers, services, and startup basics

📘 Learn from:
